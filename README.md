# Rapido Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing ride data from **Rapido**, one of India‚Äôs leading bike taxi platforms. The goal was to understand booking patterns, user preferences, cancellations, and payment trends using a mix of SQL and Power BI.

##  Tools Used
- Power BI ‚Äì for data visualization
- SQL ‚Äì for querying and data extraction
- Excel ‚Äì for initial data cleaning

## üìà Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed ride data from Rapido to understand user behavior, booking trends, and service performance. Using SQL, I queried the data to extract insights like top vehicle types, cancellation patterns, and customer ratings. Then I visualized everything using Power BI ‚Äî from ride volumes and payment methods to user ratings and revenue trends.

- Bike rides were the most popular, especially on weekends and during peak hours.
- Driver-side cancellations** were relatively high and need improvement.
- Ratings stayed consistent but showed room for better experience.
- UPI and cash were the most used payment methods.
- Suggestions were added to improve service delivery and trust.
